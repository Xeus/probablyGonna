probablyGonna, a project for my comm. lab class at NYU-ITP from 2011-2012.  The idea is that you set up events for a calendar by suggesting a possible meeting place and rough time first, then people can join on the fly, instead of requiring people to agree on a strict time like with most scheduling.  Use case for me: I'm out on Saturday night in Adams Morgan but don't know where to go.  Oh hey, my classmate's party is at Napoleon.  Gonna crash it!

My first stab at using ruby + sinatra.  You probably don't want to use this code but I figured I'd post it anyway. :)

Requirements are in config.ru.
